# Algorithms Dollhouse

A survey of very, very basic implementations of ML algorithms I'd like to make 
sure I fully understand. This is my attempt at making them little code dolls 
and having them play house.

## Rules
* Must use meaningful variable names (`learning_rate` vs. `alpha`)
* Only import Numpy

## In the dollhouse
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
    * Gaussian
* K-Means
